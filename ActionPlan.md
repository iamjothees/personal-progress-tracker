**Action Plan: Progress Tracker**

**Tech Stack:** 
- **Backend:** Laravel API
- **Frontend:** React + Capacitor JS
- **Storage:** Consider IndexedDB/LocalForage for offline-first on mobile

**Phase 1: Core Foundation**
- Design database schema (projects, tasks, time_logs, milestones)
- Build Laravel API with auth (Sanctum/Passport)
- Basic CRUD for projects and tasks

**Phase 2: Time Tracking**
- Timer functionality (start/stop/pause)
- Manual time entry
- Time estimates vs actual tracking
- Daily/weekly time aggregation

**Phase 3: Progress Metrics**
- Task completion percentage per project
- Visual progress indicators (project-to-project comparison)
- Velocity calculation (tasks completed over time)
- ETA predictions based on historical data

**Phase 4: Mobile UX**
- Quick-add task interface (minimal taps)
- Home screen widgets for active timer
- Push notifications for daily standup/review
- Offline-first architecture with sync
- PWA manifest for install prompt
- Service worker for offline capability
- Capacitor native features (notifications, background tasks)

**Phase 5: Polish**
- Dashboard with insights
- Export/backup functionality
- Dark mode

Start with Phase 1-2 as MVP. Phases run 1-2 weeks each depending on complexity.

**Key Capacitor plugins you'll need:**
- `@capacitor/local-notifications` - for reminders
- `@capacitor/preferences` - for local settings/cache
- `@capacitor/app` - for background timer state
